[![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/j2j5dmerila9cpcj?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/oriches/xxx-markets-interview-orderbook)

Built with .NET 6.0.

What is this?

This is the solution to an interview coding test I should have sent....

_Why didn't I do it this way?_

Simply because it was a 'warmup' from my point of view, and to be honest I'm glad because I didn't get any feedback from the agent or XXX about my submission.

_Why make it available to anyone else?_

Simply because I don't like being 'ghosted', it's not very professional. Also, may be help someone in the future :)

Code Structure:

Most of the code was provided and as the PDF states the test was to implement the OrderConsumer class, the test data was provided.

The spec for the test is available as pdf - [Download PDF](https://github.com/oriches/Xxx.Markets.Interview.OrderBook/blob/main/Development%20Task.pdf)
